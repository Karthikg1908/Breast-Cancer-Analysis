# Breast Cancer Analysis Using Python

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set**. It consists of various features related to tumor characteristics, such as size, texture, and shape, which are valuable for predicting the presence of cancer. 

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).

### Key Features
- **Radius:** Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.
- **Texture:** Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
- **Perimeter:** Length of the tumor's perimeter.
- **Area:** Area of the tumor.
- **Smoothness:** Local variation in radius lengths.

### Target Variable
- **Diagnosis:** M (Malignant) or B (Benign).

This dataset is widely used for machine learning classification tasks and provides a solid foundation for analyzing breast cancer predictions.
