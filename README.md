# Breast Cancer Analysis Using Python

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set**. It consists of various features related to tumor characteristics, such as size, texture, and shape, which are valuable for predicting the presence of cancer. 

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).

### Key Features
- **Radius:** Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.
- **Texture:** Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
- **Perimeter:** Length of the tumor's perimeter.
- **Area:** Area of the tumor.
- **Smoothness:** Local variation in radius lengths.

### Target Variable
- **Diagnosis:** M (Malignant) or B (Benign).

This dataset is widely used for machine learning classification tasks and provides a solid foundation for analyzing breast cancer predictions.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the Breast Cancer Analysis project:

1. **Load the Dataset:** 
   - Import the dataset using Pandas to explore its structure and contents.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize data distributions and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Identify patterns and trends in the dataset.

3. **Preprocess the Data:**
   - Handle any missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
   - Scale or normalize features as needed for model training.

4. **Split the Dataset:**
   - Divide the dataset into training and test sets using `train_test_split` from Scikit-learn.

5. **Train a Classification Model:**
   - Implement and train classification algorithms such as Decision Trees or Random Forest on the training set.

6. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model performance.
   - Generate confusion matrices and classification reports for detailed evaluation.
